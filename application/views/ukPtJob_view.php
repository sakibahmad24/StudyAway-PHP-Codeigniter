    <p>In recent years, the UK immigration rules have become very strict and stringent. This applies to even non-immigrant visas like the Student Visa. In case any international student doesn’t comply with the rules laid down by the UKBA, they risk facing deportation. Following are the restrictions on working part-time while on <a href="https://studyabroad.shiksha.com/uk-student-visa-guide-applycontent5763" target="_blank">UK student visa</a> (Tier 4):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maximum of <strong>20 hours per week</strong> of paid/unpaid work for those studying at degree level or more</li>
        <li>Maximum of 10 hours per week of paid/unpaid work during course term for language center students</li>
        <li>Full-time work is allowed during vacations</li>
        <li>You can’t work full time until you have received a work permit (Tier 2)</li>
        <li>Self-employment  is not permitted, like any freelance or consultancy work</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Before taking any part-time job, work placement, internship, unpaid or volunteer work check that your tier 4 (general) visa status allows you to work in the <a href="https://studyabroad.shiksha.com/uk" target="_blank">UK</a>. Working for too many hours can make you feel tired and stressed, which will directly affect your studies. That’s why many universities and colleges recommend international students work for a maximum of 15 hours per week. The reasoning behind this is maintaining a study-life balance. You need to think about how a job will affect your daily life, and seek help from your tutor or international student support officer if you have any concerns.</p>		<!-- Download Guide Widget STARTS-->
