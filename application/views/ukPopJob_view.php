<p>A decade back, when the recession was at its peak, there were thousands of UK nationals and foreign nationals were chasing jobs across the <a href="https://studyabroad.shiksha.com/uk" target="_blank">UK</a>. New jobs were scarcely being created and unemployment figures had soared high.</p>
<p>Now as the economy has improved, so has UK’s job prospects. Recruitment of postgraduate students at Britain’s top companies this year has almost reached the highest level for more than a decade. The median starting salary at UK’s leading employers will increase to £30,000 per year for this year’s fresh graduates. Following is the table with numbers for job openings per year in the most sought-after sectors, and the average base salary as well.</p>
